## Features of the program 

- Priority Landing System – Emergency landings override all other requests

- FIFO Takeoff Queue – Takeoffs are processed in arrival order

- Random Request Generation – Simulates realistic landing/takeoff probabilities

- Unique Flight Numbers – Prevents duplicate identifiers

- Real-Time Output – Prints every request and control action instantly

## How It Works?

- Flights are assigned unique IDs 
- Takeoffs are handled in the order they arrive (FIFO)
- The simulation runs for a configurable number of steps, performing a series of random actions and processess the most urgent flight at the moment
